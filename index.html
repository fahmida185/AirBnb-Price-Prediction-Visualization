						<h1> <strong> This is a Visualization of </strong>Airbnb revenue flow whih tends to be systematic but geographically uneven and creating rent gap in recognizable neighborhoods subject to extensive long-term rental.
						The project has been motivated by a San Francisco poster and we performed analysis on 3 years of Airbnb activity in Toronto to measure <br>
						1. the amount of rental housing lost to Airbnb, <br>
						2. Revenue flows into the short-term rental market, <br>
						3. identify neighborhoods significantly impacted by short-term rentals at the cost of long-term rental housing created by <br>

								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<h3>
									Airbnb is not affecting Toronto real estate
									market as it is capturing a very minimal <2% housing stock out of
Toronto housing stock. However, in Vancouver, Airbnb as
decreased its scale by reducing its listing stock in comparison to
2016. We found out the best time and place for Toronto homeowners’
highest revenue-generation. Homeowner rents out their home is to
earn revenue from either long or short-term rentals. We already
know the highest revenue-generating season of the year for Airbnb
but long-term rental cannot exhibit seasonal price fluctuation.
Therefore, short-term business aims to maximize revenues from
renting out their property then. Pulling out the specific average
prices in the month of March in 2018, we can see that the price
ranged from $138–$140. Hence, an actionable next step
for the prospective Airbnb homeowner is to check which
neighborhood their home is in and see what is the competitive prices
for their home in that time of year, while checking how popular their
neighborhoods is. That being said, an important caveat for this
analysis is that the data is only for one year’s worth of house listings.
The trends might be different for 2018.

would generate the most revenue for a Toronto homeowner, we
performed neighborhood analysis the analysis for short and longterm market. Areas with the highest price may not be popular with
guests or renter.
